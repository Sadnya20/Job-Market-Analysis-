Empowering enterprises to keep the planet habitable for all!

Reversing the impact of climate change is one of the world’s biggest challenges. And businesses have a responsibility to lead the way. While individual consumer choices are important, over 80% of all the emissions reductions necessary for the world to reach Net-Zero, require business-level action. But despite the growing momentum and ambition from companies around the world to set Net-Zero goals, there are significant challenges to delivering on these ambitions. Business leaders don’t really know how they will get there. And the very first step, of getting emissions measurement right, is hard.

Terrascope is an enterprise-grade, end-to-end decarbonisation SaaS platform. By combining AI-assisted carbon measurement & management with deep industry & sustainability expertise, Terrascope helps solve the data management, emissions reduction planning and implementation challenges that large enterprises face to decarbonise their operations and complex supply chains.

In this role you will:
• Collaborate with our Customer Success Managers and interface with the client to define the data required to complete a customer’s carbon footprint measurement
• Work with customers to help them provide the correct data required for calculating their greenhouse gas emission inventory across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 for corporate emissions, and full life cycle for product emissions. Provide guidance on what additional data is required to enrich raw data sets for footprint measurement.
• Transform unstructured data sets provided by clients into structured data which can be ingested into our product’s data processing pipeline to calculate carbon emissions.
• Use our platform to calculate, map, and publish carbon footprints that will be used by a company for their climate strategies, actions, and reports.
• Support companies to understand their sources of greenhouse gas emissions, set emissions reduction targets, and identify the most impactful decarbonisation opportunities.
• Document carbon accounting methodologies and advise customers on opportunities to improve their data year-on-year.

Salary: £90-115k (includes comprehensive benefits package)

Our Mission: Fixing Trust in Commerce

For a decade, we've been on a mission to close the Trust Gap—commerce's most expensive problem. In a world where distance and digital interfaces separate buyers and sellers, we're building the definitive trust infrastructure that enables global trade to flourish.

We recognize that trust is not binary but a spectrum, and our work continually expands the boundaries of commerce itself. Each improvement we make enables transactions that previously wouldn't have happened, revealing new frontiers where trust can be further enhanced.

Our Impact Today

We've grown from an idea into the dominant force for trust in e-commerce:
• Shopify's #1 Review Solution: We've earned over 42k five-star reviews from merchants who rely on us daily
• Global Scale: More than 500k shops across 140+ countries use our platform
• Massive Reach: We process over 70 million orders monthly, generating 2 million+ verified buyer reviews

Organic Growth: We've achieved 40% year-over-year growth purely through word of mouth—no paid marketing or sales teams needed

The Opportunity

As our Data Lead, you'll lead the development of our Trust Optimisation Platform—a critical initiative to unlock insights from our vast review dataset to help merchants improve their e-commerce trust metrics. This role will build the data foundation that powers our next generation of merchant-facing products, directly supporting our mission to close the Trust Gap in e-commerce.

• Strategic Data Leadership: Architect and build product data infrastructure to transform review data into actionable merchant insights
• NLP/ML Development: Create models that analyse review content, identify trust patterns, and establish merchant benchmarks
• Pipeline Architecture: Build scalable systems that efficiently process our extensive review and merchant data
• Cross-Functional Collaboration: Work with product and design teams to translate data insights into user-facing features and new products.

Your Approach: Think in Systems and Platforms

Your role will be to build extensible systems that provide compounding value over time. You'll:
• Build the initial sentiment and topic classification models for review analysis
• Develop merchant benchmarking methodology across various industry categories
• Create data pipelines that integrate with our existing systems
• Implement efficient ETL processes to ensure data quality and reliability
• Design the data architecture with future expansion in mind
• Transform our product data into a strategic asset that delivers measurable value to merchants
• Enable data-driven decisions that help merchants improve their trust metrics and customer satisfaction
• Build the foundation for future product offerings
• Work with our product team to continuously refine insights based on merchant feedback

What You'll Bring

Must-Haves
• 5+ years experience in data engineering and data science roles
• Strong programming skills in Python and SQL
• Experience building NLP/ML models, particularly for text classification or sentiment analysis
• Background in developing data pipelines and ETL processes
• Proven ability to translate complex data models into business insights

You'll join us as we build the next generation of data-driven trust tools. Your work will directly contribute to how e-commerce merchants build trust with their customers globally, while establishing the foundation for our future product innovations.

Our Culture: Results-Driven Excellence

We reward exceptional performance and are building a team that consistently pushes for better results. Success here means finding innovative ways to achieve more with our existing resources. We value time above all else—it's our scarcest resource. We budget time more strictly than money, establishing short feedback loops and breaking initiatives into their smallest units of value.

Our international team brings diverse perspectives to every challenge. We believe in lifting each other up through active knowledge sharing because our collective strength determines our success.

Who we are

We are the first publicly-traded biotech or pharmaceutical company to take the form of a public benefit corporation. Our public benefit purpose is to provide a brighter future for patients through the development of novel pharmaceutical therapies; and technologies that expand the availability of transplantable organs.

United Therapeutics (Nasdaq: UTHR) seeks to travel down the corridors of indifference to develop treatments for rare, deadly diseases. We were founded in 1996 by a family seeking a cure for their daughter's pulmonary arterial hypertension( PAH). Today, we have six FDA-approved therapies that treat PAH, pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD) and neuroblastoma, a rare pediatric cancer. Our near-term pipeline seeks to develop additional therapies for PAH and pulmonary fibrosis (PF).

The cure for end-stage life-threatening diseases like PAH, PH-ILD, PF, and many others is an organ transplant, but only a small percentage of donated organs are available to address the vast need. For this reason, we are working to create manufactured organs to address the shortage of kidneys, hearts, lungs, and livers available for transplant. We believe an unlimited supply of tolerable, transplantable organs will eliminate the transplant waiting list and cure end-stage organ diseases for which transplant is not currently an option.
